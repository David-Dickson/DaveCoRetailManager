# DaveCo Retail Manager
A retail management system built by DaveCo Enterprise Solutions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What this project is about:
I will be creating a Windows desk top application that runs a cash register, handles inventory, and manages the entire store. Also in the future I will be building a web application using Blazor WebAssembly. 

**This will be first built on the .NET Framework, then down the line will be upgraded to .NET Core.**

*The thought process is to gain the experience to upgrade a depreciated .NET Framework to the more modern .NET Core 5 framework.*


## What I will be using:
* Unit Testing
* Design Patterns
* Dependency Injection
* WPF
* ASP.NET MVC
* SSDT
* Git
* CI/CD with Azure DevOps
* Further technologies will be added along the way
